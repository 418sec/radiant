Description:
    The extension generator creates stubs for a new Radiant extension.
    
    The generator takes an extension name as its argument.  The extension name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Extension'.
    
    The generator creates an extension directory in vendor/extensions that includes
    <extension_name>_extension.rb, README and Rakefile files as well as db, lib, task,
    and test directories.

Example:
    rails generate extension Site
